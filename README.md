# Time-Series
Time series is a sequence of data points in chronological order. Models like ARIMA, GARCH, and LSTM are used for analysis and prediction. Applications include stock market prediction, demand forecasting, weather forecasting, economic analysis, and anomaly detection.

In the present project I've used LSTM model for stock prediction.
